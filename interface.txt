Mahbob: 

Connection([constructor calls setParams]) - class

	- setParams([Paste parameters here]): void
	- runCommand(string): string


Safi: 

DeviceScanner(Connection) - class
	- setOldData(DataObject): void
	- getOldData(): DataObject
	- updateData(DataObject): ScanObject
		(retrieves new Data and (if possible compares them with the old data))

ScanObject() - Value Object
this contains a DataObject and a ChangesObject
(Maybe the ChangesObject is just a DataObject)
(you can fill this Object on the way you like)

DataObject - Value Object
contains information of the switch
I can read out the information with a lot of getter
get...?(): string or array or (even better) object
Some information might differ and i have to read them. 
if you make an array, pls document well what is where, otherwise make another object

After the project is finished we will export your classes 
as an available library for other people accessing switches via ssh

there aren't any interfaces as such in python, so we are just producing the classes
